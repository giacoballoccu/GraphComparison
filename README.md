# Graph Comparison

1. [Introduction](#Introduction)
The purpose of this project is to compare a graph class and its method against the state of art Pyspark class for graph operations (GraphFrame). Compare the results, in time of execution and show the superiority of parallel computing against not parallelized data structures when dealing with high dimensional data. Also, the project has the purpose of showing the relationship between the number of workers nodes and computation times for graph related problems. The dataset used is the Twitch-Social-Network dataset [1] of Standard university which is composed of 7,126 nodes and 35,324 edges.
